# Federated-Learning-with-CNN-using-CICIoV2024
Federated Learning model implementation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained and evaluated on the CICIoV2024 dataset for intrusion detection in in-vehicle networks.

📘 Overview:
This repository presents an implementation of a Federated Learning (FL) framework integrated with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, trained and evaluated using the CICIoV2024 dataset. The project aims to design a decentralized, privacy-preserving intrusion detection system for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environments while maintaining high accuracy and robust model performance.

🎯 Objectives:
1. Develop a CNN-based intrusion detection model for IoV network data.
2. Integrate the model within a federated learning framework to preserve data privacy across clients.
3. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics.
4. Compare results for both binary and multi-class classification scenarios.
